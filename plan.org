#+STARTUP: showstars
* Plan
** TODO Network module
*** P2P solution
*** TCP for internode communication
    A socket for receiving from the previous node, and
    a socket for transmitting to the next node.
*** Reliability built into the module
    If a node loses connection to the next node it automatically
    connects to the next-next node instead. It also informs the
    rest of the network of this change so that the needed actions
    can be made.
*** JSON for serialization
*** Init
    Node queries for IP address to next node and next-next node.
    Creates a persistent TCP connection to the next node. This is
    done for alle the nodes in the network.
** TODO Elevator driver
*** Implement driver in python
** TODO Process-pairs
*** Communication between processes
*** Auto-create new process on start up
