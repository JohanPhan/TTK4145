Theory:
	An atomic operation is an operation that either completed or not completed. It can not be
	aborted or interrupted.

	A mutex provides MUTual EXclusion to a resource, meaning that only one thread has access to 
	the resource at any given moment. 

	A semaphore is a generalized mutex. It divides the resource into pieces and allowes different 
	threads to work on different pieces at the same time.

	A critical section is a snippet of code that needs to be run in series, it can't lose access to
	the resource without it crippling the result.
